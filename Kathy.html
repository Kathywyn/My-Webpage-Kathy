        	I have a wide range of hobbies. I enjoy reading, singing, drawing, and so on. Among them, my favourite one is playing the piano. I have learnt to play the piano for more than 10 years and I am deeply attracted by this beautiful instrument. Piano is just like my best friend who always company me whenever I need. It can always help comfort me. I really love it.

			<b>What Interests Me About This Class:</b>
        </p>

        <p class = "maincontent">
			I have tried designing a game with my classmate and I found it really difficult but interesting. Web design is different from game design but I think there may be something similar between these two works. That's why I am interested in this class. Trying something new is really interesting.

			<b>The Website I Vist More Often:</b>
        </p>

		<p class = "maincontent">
			Bilibili. I use the website to watch various videos which bring me happiness. Sometimes, the videos can also help broaden my horizon and let me gain much knowledge. I enjoy visiting the website. However, there are some persons make some comments, the words of which are not so kind. Those words may turn down my mood. That's where I dislike of the website.
